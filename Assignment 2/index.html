            The map visualization gives an overview of the <b>distribution of the Top 2000 companies locations</b>. Each marker represents a <b>country</b> and the markers, 
            on the map are color coded to show their <b>continents</b>. The size of each marker reflects the <b>mean market value</b>, 
            which is calculated by dividing the market value by the number of Top 2000 companies, in that particular location.
          </p>
          <p>
            Notably, among all the countries, <span style="color: #ff7f00;"><b>The Netherlands</b></span> distinguishes itself with a market value of <span style="color: #ff7f00;"><b>$32.23 billion</b></span>. 
            This observation comes as no surprise, as The Netherlands boasts an above-average total market value while having a smaller number of Top 2000 companies compared to other nations. 
            This unique combination is a contributing factor to its elevated market value.
          </p>
          <p>
            Conversely, <span style="color: #ff7f00;"><b>Greece</b></span> holds the distinction of having the lowest mean market value among all countries, 
            amounting to a mere <span style="color: #ff7f00;"><b>$2.24 billion</b></span>. While it does maintain a presence in the double digits with ten Top 2000 companies, 
            its relatively low total market value places it at the bottom of the list.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="pure-u-1-2" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 10px;">
          <p>
            In contrast countries, like <span style="color: #377eb8;"><b>China</b></span>, <span style="color: #ff7f00;"><b>the United Kingdom</b></span>, <span style="color: #377eb8;"><b>Japan</b></span> and 
            <span style="color: #e41a1c;"><b>the United States</b></span> have total market values but also more Top 2000 companies. 
            This slightly reduces their market values compared to The Netherlands. However these countries still have a <b>higher</b> average market values compared to other nations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, while there are only two countries in <span style="color: #a65628;"><b>Oceania</b></span> that house Top 2000 companies, <span style="color: #a65628;"><b>Australia</b></span>'s ability to achieve a notably high mean market value is indeed an impressive accomplishment, 
            which emphasizing its significant economic position, on a global scale.

            So after examining their geographical locations and assessing their mean market values,

            The <b>left</b> radial chart illustrates the <b>percentage distribution</b> of the Top 2000 companies across <b>continents</b>, 
            while the <b>right</b> radial chart displays the <b>distribution</b> of Top 2000 companies by <b>country</b>. 
            Both charts are color-coded to represent the respective continents.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking at the <b>continent-wise distribution</b>, <span style="color: #377eb8;"><b>Asia</b></span>'s dominance in housing the <b>highest</b> number of Top 2000 companies is a reflection of its economic prowess. 
            Notably, <span style="color: #377eb8;"><b>China</b></span> and <span style="color: #377eb8;"><b>Japan</b></span>, both Asian powerhouses, stand out as <b>major contributors</b> to this dominance. With their thriving business landscapes, 
            they consistently make a significant impact on the global corporate stage. 
            The impressive number of companies from these countries further solidifies their positions as key players in the international business arena.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it's important to emphasize that while Asia leads the way, <span style="color: #e41a1c;"><b>North America</b></span> and <span style="color: #ff7f00;"><b>Europe</b></span> should not be underestimated. 
            These continents have robust economies and diverse business landscapes, resulting in a substantial representation of Top 2000 companies. 
            <span style="color: #e41a1c;"><b>The United States</b></span>, in particular, takes a <b>commanding lead</b> in terms of the sheer number of enterprises, with <span style="color: #e41a1c;"><b>588</b></span> companies making the list. 
            This underscores the country's economic might and its position as a global economic leader.

        <div class="pure-u-1-2" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 10px;">
          <p>
            <span style="color: #377eb8;"><b>China</b></span>, following closely behind the U.S. with <span style="color: #377eb8;"><b>367</b></span> companies, is not just a regional force but also a significant contender on the world stage. 
            The same can be said for <span style="color: #377eb8;"><b>Japan</b></span>, with <span style="color: #377eb8;"><b>217</b></span> companies, showcasing its enduring corporate strength and influence.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Europe, <span style="color: #ff7f00;"><b>the United Kingdom's 77</b></span> companies and <span style="color: #ff7f00;"><b>Canada's 61</b></span> companies are notable contributors to the regional and global business landscape. 
            These figures underscore their respective roles as key players in Europe and North America, contributing to the overall diversity and strength of the Top 2000 ranking.
          </p>
          <p>
            In summary, while Asia's dominance is evident, a deeper analysis reveals that the Top 2000 companies are spread across continents, 
            highlighting the global nature of these enterprises and the multifaceted contributions of various regions to the corporate world.

            The first bubble chart offers a detailed examination of the interplay between a company's <b>Assets</b> and its <b>Sales</b>, providing insights into their connection. 
            In this visualization, the size of each bubble serves as a visual representation of the <b>Assets Turnover Rate</b>. 
            This rate is meticulously calculated by dividing a company's Sales by its Total Assets, shedding light on how effectively the company leverages its assets to generate revenue.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly, the second bubble chart delves into the relationship between a company's <b>Assets</b> and its <b>Profits</b>. 
            Each bubble's size signifies the <b>Return On Assets Ratio</b>, a crucial metric derived by dividing Total Profits by Total Assets. 
            This ratio provides a deeper understanding of a company's profitability concerning its asset portfolio. 
            It unveils how efficiently the company utilizes its assets to generate profits, showcasing its effectiveness in translating asset strength into financial success.

            Companies positioned in the <b>right quadrant</b> of the chart, such as <span style="color: #377eb8;"><b>ICBC</b></span> and <span style="color: #377eb8;"><b>China Construction Bank</b></span>, 
            exemplify <b>substantial Asset bases and commendable Sales/Profits performance</b>. 
            Take ICBC, for instance, a banking giant that adeptly harnesses its assets to yield substantial revenue, exemplifying its operational prowess.
          </p>
          <p>
            Notably, among this select group, <span style="color: #e41a1c;"><b>Exxon Mobil</b></span> emerges as a standout performer. Leveraging its substantial asset portfolio, 
            <span style="color: #e41a1c;"><b>Exxon Mobil</b></span> achieves an <b>Assets Turnover Ratio</b> surpassing <b>1</b> and a robust <b>Return On Assets</b> Ratio exceeding <b>0.05</b>. 
            This impressive performance underscores Exxon Mobil's exceptional ability to efficiently convert its assets into substantial sales and profits, 
            marking it as an exemplar in the realm of asset utilization and profitability.
